#+title: Textual Bar Charts

At the end of episode 75 of the [[https://www.teachingpython.fm/75][Teaching Python Podcast]], [[https://twitter.com/@smtibor][Sean]] mentions that he saw someone say they used dictionaries to create these textual bar charts. I have also been seeing a lot about the [[https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html][rich]] module for python written by [[https://twitter.com/willmcgugan][Will McGuan]]. I thought it would be a cool little project to combine these two ideas.

I created a little script that charts my class sizes by period. The whole script can be written in less than 10 lines of code. Just run `pip install rich` and you should be good to go.
