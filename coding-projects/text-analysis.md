#Text Analysis

I was learning webscraping awhile back and decided to scrape the federalist papers from the [library of congress](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/full-text). I wrote a script that stores the full text of all 85 papers in a `.txt` file. then I created a word counter that filters out stop words.Then I added a word cloud feature. I definitely see some potential for language arts social studies.
