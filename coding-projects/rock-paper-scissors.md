# Rock Paper Scissors

The classic game has only three moves with a relatively simple sample space.

| Attacker | Rock | Paper | Scissors |
|----------|------|-------|----------|
| Rock     | draw | lose  | win      |
| Paper    | win  | draw  | lose     |
| Scissors | lose | win   | draw     |

This is already a great place to start for beginner coders. But with just a few sweet additions and the implementation of classes, you can scale up the code for any number of moves as long as the sample space is written out in say a .csv file.

Here is the sample space for 15 way rock paper scissors.
