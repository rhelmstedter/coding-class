# Meme Generator

This project was inspired by [Teaching Python's conversation with Mike Driscoll](https://www.teachingpython.fm/66). Mike just released a new book [Pillow: Image Processing with Python](https://leanpub.com/pillow). I believe at one point Mike says, "you can make a meme by adding text to the image." Between that and The Art of Code image manipulation, I thought that would be a perfect little project for my middle school coding students.

I decided to go with replit for this project. I created a couple of samples and covered what each line of the code does. Changed some of the text together as a class and then sent them loose. If I ever get around to it I will create a screen cast that explains how the script works.
