# Bagels

Don't let the name fool you (as it did me), this is awesome. [Bagels](https://www.armoredpenguin.com/bagels/) is a logic game originally played with paper and pencil. This is from Al Sweigart's [Big Book of Small Python Projects](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/). I modified the code so that it uses snake case instead of camel case and is formatted with f-strings. I also added a function for validating the user's guess. I plan to give students a template that includes the directions for the game to avoid making them type everything. It will also serve as an outline for the program.
