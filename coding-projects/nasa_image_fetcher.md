# NASA Image Fetcher

This idea is originally from [BugBytes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXAo8zaXQJY&list=PL-2EBeDYMIbSIvtqLVYCxW7XX14vN6_yc&index=1). I stumbled across this when I was learning how [typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) works.

I just started a variation of this project with 6th, 7th, and 8th graders. They loved it. I omitted the typer portion for two reasons:

1. students are coding in replit so python isn't actually installed on their machine.
2. I didn't want to add too much all at once. We are just covering requests and they haven't see any cli tools (at least in my class).

Instead, we used user input to get a date. Then we used the datetime module to validate that it was a good date.

## Sample Code

- [Replit Complete](https://replit.com/@MrHelmstedter/NASA-APOD-Period-1#main.py)
- [local version](coding-progjects/nasa_image_fetcher.py)
