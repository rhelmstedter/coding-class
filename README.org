#+TITLE: Coding Class

This repository is a collection of coding projects for my middle school coding classes. The 2021-2022 school year will be my second year teaching coding. As I gain more experience coding I plan to piece together various coding projects aimed at beginners. Since my students are all on Chromebooks, all projects will use either [[https://codehs.com][codehs]] or [[https://youtu.be/xoo4mTujM1U][Google Colabortory (Colab)]].

** Inspiration
I recently stumbled across the excellent [[https://www.teachingpython.fm/][Teaching Python Podcast]]. I highly recommend it.

Dylan Beattie has an amazing talk [[https://youtu.be/6avJHaC3C2U][The Art of Code]] that speaks to the creative side of coding. I plan to incorporate a bunch of ideas from this talk in my coding class.

| Talk               | Project                 |
|--------------------+-------------------------|
| Logo               | [[./coding-projects/Data-Spiral.org][DATA Spiral]]             |
| Game of life       | Game of life?           |
| Image Manipulation | [[file:coding-projects/meme_generator.org][Meme Generator]]          |
| Obfuscated Code    | ??? But sounds awesome  |
| Weird Languages    | Compare language syntax |
| Machine Learning   | [[file:./coding-projects/machine-learning.org][Machine Learning 4 Kids]] |
| Music              | [[file:./coding-projects/Earscketch.org][Earsketch]]               |

** Code Reading Exercises
In her book _The Programmer's Brain_, Felienne Hermans speaks about the importance of reading code. I want to put together a series of code snippets that students can practice reading and determining the output. (Perhaps these can be sorted into categories?)

** Coding Practice
The websites below offer +short+ interesting coding challenges for a range of abilities.

- [[https://pybit.es/][Pybites]]:: Python specific. Great for new coders and really nicely organized. Paid.
- [[https://www.codewars.com/][Codewars]]:: Language Agnostic. Slick interface, but can be difficult to find accessible challenges if students are brand new to coding. Free.
- [[https://picoctf.org/][picoCTF]]:: Not specific to coding. This is a capture the flag competition aimed at improving general computer hacking skills. Free
- [[https://projecteuler.net/][Project Euler]]:: Language agnostic. Math centric problems designed to be solved with code. Free.

** Non-coding Assignments
- [[file:coding-projects/song_analysis.org][Song Analysis]]
